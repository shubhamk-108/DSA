//  string is a linear data structure that stores a sequence of characters. These characters can include letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
//  String is an object in Java and C++, a string is a distinct data type or object. For instance, C++ has a string class
//  Regardless of the language, each character in a string is associated with a unique index. This allows for direct access to individual characters 
//  for various operations like searching or modification.

//  strings, an index is a number that represents the position of a character within that string. Since strings are sequential collections of 
//  characters, each character has a specific place in that sequence
//  The first character is at index 0.
// The second character is at index 1.
// The third character is at index 2, and so on.
